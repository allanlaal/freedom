Freedom Calendar is a service to sync your Facebook events to your calendar of choice, with only two clicks - and with the added benefit of removing spammy, unwanted events.

If you are like me, you have been overloaded by annoying events from friends you don't even know. These events find their way into the calendar on you phone and computer, before you can click "Unattend!!".

This service will filter your events, so only the events you are attending, or maybe attending will show up.
